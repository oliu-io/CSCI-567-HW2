# Bring Your Own BERT

In this assignment, we will implement our own BERT model from scratch! We strongly recommend you read through the [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) paper before getting started. Jay Alammar's [tutorial](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/) could be really handy as well!

To get started, first clone this repo and run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can find all the TODO's in `bert_impl.py`. Search for `NotImplementedError` and work through each of the code segment. To verify your implementation, run
```
python bert_impl.py
```
for executing test functions. We recommend you do this after each segment!
